====================
Lusty Juggler
====================

Launch the juggler with this key combo:::

      <Leader>lj           "(jug | juggle) [n]"

The buffer names are mapped to the home row and numbers.

If you want to switch to that buffer, press "f" or "4" again or press "<ENTER>".

If you changed your mind, cancel the juggler with any of "q", "<ESC>", "<C-c", "<BS>", "<Del>", or "<C-h>".
